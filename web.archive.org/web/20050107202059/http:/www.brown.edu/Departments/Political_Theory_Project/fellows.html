She is pursuing her Ph.D. in Political Theory in the Department of Political Science at Brown University. Her research focuses on contemporary liberal theory, with special attention given to liberal international norms. Her broader research and teaching interests extend to multiculturalism, theories of rights, ethics and public policy and the interplay of political theory and economics.

 <br><br>

Carmen’s dissertation explores the implications of institutional pluralism for liberal international norms. In particular, she asks whether substantive duties of justice for distant others can be derived from domestic liberal values. She argues that the liberalism prevalent in contemporary academic discourse needs to develop a better grounded respect for plural and sometimes conflicting of conceptions of the good life and their diverse institutional expressions and to contain its universalistic ambitions.<br><br></td></table></td></table>

dissertation for the University of Toronto (Ph.D. expected in December
2004). His current research focuses on John Locke's Two Treatises
of Government.  Generally taken to be contain to the standard
Seventeenth-Century Whig argument for the rule of law, the Treatises
curiously justify something of the opposite:  prerogative, or the
legitimate authority to act against the law.  This observation leads to
the following inquiries.  Why would extralegal action be legitimate?
How can it be reconciled with the rule of law?  What is to prevent the
wielder of prerogative from using it tyrannically?  The Second
Treatise in particular is an attempt to grapple with these questions.
 Locke's handling of these matters is analyzed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050108085320/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Political_Theory_Project/corbert.pdf">Full CV (PDF)</a><br><br></td></table></td></table>

	<br>Dr. Tebble is currently completing a book on Hayekian political theory and its relationship to the politics of identity.  Discovering Cultural Justice: Identity, Democracy and the Discursive Minimal State  extends recent Hayek scholarship to ask what relevance Hayek’s perspective has to contemporary theorising about justice; in particular to the problematic of theorising justice under conditions of cultural diversity.  In this regard, Discovering Cultural Justice serves two purposes: to extend our knowledge of Hayek’s corpus and, by way of offering an interpretative rereading of it, to contribute a new perspective to debates about

the role of structured conflict in achieving constitutional fidelity. 
Using the American Constitution, she analyzes three different kinds of 
constitutional conflict. First, she examines the tension between free 
speech and national security to explore how political conflict configured 
around multiple constitutional values can render liberal democratic 
commitments more secure over the long term. Second, she evaluates the 
judicial selection process to understand conflict between norms of 
political and legal decision-making. And finally, she argues that 
constitutional maintenance requires interbranch conflict, and hence advances a 
distinctive understanding of executive prerogative in war powers which does 
not seek to insulate that prerogative from scrutiny by other branches.
