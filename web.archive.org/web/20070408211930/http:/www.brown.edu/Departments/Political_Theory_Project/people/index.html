  <strong>John Tomasi, Director<br/>
  Associate Professor of Political Science</strong><br/>
<br/>
John Tomasi is Associate Professor of Political Science at Brown  University and Director of the Political Theory Project at Brown  University. He is author of <em>Liberalism Beyond Justice: Citizens Society and the Boundaries of Political Theory</em> (Princeton University Press, 2001), and numerous articles.<br/>
<br/>
He received his B.A. from Colby College, his M.A. from the University  of Arizona (1990), and his B. Phil., D. Phil. from Oxford University  (1993). He has had previous appointments at Princeton University and  Stanford University. His specializations are political theory and  ethics and public policy.<br/>
<br/>
Liberal regimes shape the ethical outlook of their citizens,  relentlessly influencing their most personal commitments over time.  This fact raises pressing questions: If liberals cannot prevent the  spillover of public values into nonpublic domains, how accommodating of  diversity can a liberal regime actually be? To what degree can a  liberal society be a home even to the people whose viewpoints it was  formally designed to include?<br/>

      His most recent research focuses upon the post-9/11 “identity  liberalism” that has arisen in many Western liberal democracies and  which defends a politics of assimilation and culturally-selective  immigration controls on liberal grounds.  A second book currently in  preparation deals with this and other themes in the politics of culture  by defending a neutralist ‘epistemological’ account of liberalism as a  response to the challenge of cultural diversity. <em>Discovering Cultural Justice: Identity, Neutrality and the State</em> addresses the challenge of diversity by way of an insight concerning  the epistemological rather than teleological rôle of liberal  institutions.  Despite the post-socialist cultural turn in politics and  the virtual disappearance of rigorously centralised economic planning,  it is claimed that this insight gives rise to a radically subversive  reformulation of the task of justice. This reformulation  allows one to defend liberal  institutions  in the face of increasingly strident  identity claims from both majority and minority communities.<br/>
