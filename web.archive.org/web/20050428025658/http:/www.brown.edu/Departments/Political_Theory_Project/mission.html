<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050313111455im_/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Political_Theory_Project/t.png">he mission of the Political Theory Project is to invigorate and deepen 
the discussion of normatively charged political issues at Brown, and 
and within the academy more generally.
<br><br>
The health of free societies rests ultimately on the degree of 
seriousness and care with which citizens form their political 
viewpoints. Having contact with teachers, lecturers and colleagues who 
sincerely hold diverse opinions on fundamental political values is 
essential to this. But within many universities today, the spectrum of 
intellectual opinion is dangerously narrow. Collectivist and 
quasi-socialist political perspectives abound within many universities, 
while important rival perspectives on political reality---notably, 
individualist, market-oriented or religious ones---rarely are attended 
to sympathetically.
<br><br>
Brown University is no exception to this trend. A recent New York Times 
described the lack of intellectual diversity at Brown generally and in 
the undergraduate curriculum in particular.  As one student quoted in 
that article reported: "I have been asked to read Marx four times at 
Brown. Adam Smith? Not even once."

<br><br>
There is no easy diagnosis for this state of affairs in American 
education. But it seems clear that the disconnection between the 
political discourse within universities and that of the wider society 
stems in part from disciplinary factionalization---and especially a 
factionalization between humanistic and social scientific approaches. 
That factionalization has resulted in a state of affairs inn which 
normative theorizing about politics is all too often conducted in a 
purely theoretical, "critical" or even literary vacuum. Critical 
thinking about politics threatens to become a wholly interior, even 
circular, enterprise. It adverts to injustices and makes claims of 
oppression, but does not propose concrete alternative systems of rule 
whose efficacy might be empirically tested.
<br><br>
The Political Theory Project is founded on the belief that critical 
thinking about politics must cash out into testable claims about our 
social world. Responsible criticism of political institutions must be 
conducted in light of economic reality and the findings of mainstream 
social science. These disciplines provide ballast to political 
discourse. They ensure that the formation of each student's political 
opinions be a result of considered, well-rounded decision---grounded in 
the complexities of historical and institutional reality---rather than 
a mere expression of intellectual fashion.
<br><br>
The Political Theory Project supports scholarship that is intimately 
concerned with how political ideas actually work in the world: 
providing prosperity, opportunity and freedom for the citizens of the 
societies that affirm them. This concern with theories that work does 
not in itself commit the Political Theory Project to any particular 
ideological orientation. We are interested in ideas and are committed 
to searching out insights from whatever parts of the political spectrum 
where we might find them. Our interest in connecting normative theory 
to actual practice, though, does direct our attention in the first 
instance to a set of norms that have a record of providing modern 
societies with a measure of stability, wealth and well-being: 
individual rights, the rule of law, private property and systems of 
market exchange, religious liberty, freedoms of speech and association, 
democratic self-governance, and the ideal of voluntarism in human 
affairs.
<br><br>
These norms are sometimes derisively associated with terms such as 
"liberalism," "classical liberalism," or even "Western Civilization." 
At the Political Theory Project we are not interested in such labels. 
Indeed, discourse at the level of labels is a central characteristic of 
the internalized, academic forms of discourse to which we mean to 
provide an alternative. The Political Theory Project is determined to 
provide space at Brown where students and faculty can go beneath the 
labels. The Political Theory Project---the courses, lectures, and 
conferences we sponsor---are places where individuals of good faith, 
and diverse viewpoints, can come together to untangle the rivalrous 
roots of political reality for themselves.
