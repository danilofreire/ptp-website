<h4>New Seminars for 2004-2005</h4>

The Political Theory Project adds an array of challenging new courses to the Brown undergraduate curriculum---large lecture courses, senior seminars and, especially, a new series of freshmen seminars. Below is a partial listing of the seminars that will be taught by Political Theory Project Fellows during the 2004-5 academic year.<br><br>

<a name="freedom"><h4><font color="black">Freedom</font></h4>

What is freedom? In this seminar, we will take up some central puzzles about the nature and value of freedom. Readings will be from a variety of disciplines---literary, poetic, historical, philosophical, religious and economic. Emphasis will be on careful reading of primary texts, precise formulation of ideas during seminar conversations, and creative written exploration on the part of each student in response to questions about freedom.
<br><table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0"><tr><td width="37%" align="left"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050313085747im_/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Political_Theory_Project/dscf0128.jpg" border="2"></td><td valign="top">
<font size="2" color="white">For example: What, if anything, makes freedom valuable? Is freedom worth having if it does not lead to truth? What if freedom leads to error? How is freedom related to other ideals such as rebelliousness or individualism? (Must one be a rebellious individualist in order to be free?) What---if any---are the cultural, economic and/or political preconditions of freedom?  Is freedom valuable to people in all cultures and at all times? Why or why not? Is personal freedom possible without economic freedom? (How about vice versa?) What is the relationship of freedom to religious or familial obligation? Can I be strictly bound and yet free? Is freedom a property of individual persons or of political communities? What would it be like to live in a society, or to study on a campus, that was free?</td></tr></table>

Among the thinkers whose works we will likely read together are: Abraham, Socrates, the Apostle John, Walt Whitman, Freidrich Nietzsche, Ludwig von Mises, Henry David Thoreau, Virginia Woolf, Isaiah Berlin, Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman and Richard Epstein.

<a name="americanfounding"><h4><font color="black">The Philosophy of the American Founding</font></h4>

 The Constitution was not crafted in a vacuum, but what precisely was
the theoretical context in which it was created?  What problems were
 the Founders attempting to address, and why did they believe these
 problems to be paramount?  A great deal of modern scholarship centers
 on the influence that the English philosopher John Locke wielded, some scholars arguing that his was the primary influence, others that his influence has been
 overstated. This seminar will examine these claims by comparing John
 Locke's thought with that of some of the more influential Founders.

 Toleration and we will then turn to how the Founders expressed themselves regarding
 these questions.  Our main focus will be on the Federalist Papers,
 supplemented with some readings from those who opposed the
 Constitution or justified it on different grounds.  What was supported
 by the authors of the Federalist Papers?  Where did they disagree with
 their fellow citizens?  What common ground was shared by both sides?†
 And how much ground was shared with Locke?
 <br><br>
 Evaluation will be through several essays and class participation.†
 We shall go through these works relatively slowly, attempting to gain
 a greater understanding of them through a close reading.

<a name="fahayek"><h4><font color="black">The Political and Economic Thought of F. A. Hayek</font></h4>

Friedrich Hayek, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, was one of the most influential--and controversial---thinkers of the 20th century. Writing from a European tradition, Hayek's work combines political philosophy, legal theory and economic rigor in an integrated fashion and at a level thought to be rarely reached in today's academy. It was not only Hayek's method that was radical, however. Launching his career at a high-water mark of collectivist and socialist thinking, Hayek argued that there is instead a deep connection between totalitarianism and systems of centralized planning of all kinds. 
<br>
<table border="0" width="99%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="7"><tr><td width="37%" align="center"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050313085747im_/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Political_Theory_Project/0051.jpg" border="2"></td><td valign="top"><font size="2" color="white">This thesis earned the young Hayek tremendous notoriety--even contempt--since it implied that one could not pick and choose between "bad" and "good" forms of centralized planning--whether it was Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union or those forms of planning practiced increasingly in Sweden and Western Europe (as well as in the United States). The decay and eventual collapse of the Soviet empire is widely perceived to have "vindicated" Hayek's central theses. The question remains whether his concerns about the corrupting tendencies of centralized power within the other Western powers will also be borne out. This freshman seminar will introduce students to Hayek's thought. The seminar will focus on thee role of liberty in Hayek's account of political association. Starting from the philosophical fundamentals of his thought, it will be seen that his specifically individualist account of political liberty is the result of a generalisation of a thesis about the nature of</td></tr></table>  the self and the limits of its faculty of reason. Later, we will be concerned to investigate how Hayek's core idea about reason is cashed out not only in his writings on politics but also on law and economics.  We will conclude by examining to what extent, if at all, Hayek's account of political, legal and economic liberty is a coherent one and how it fares against some important objections, both from the political left and from the political right today.

What effect does liberty of the mind have on the way individuals and societies decide what is right and enforce those decisions?  We begin with Plato's classic statement in The Apology of Socrates and go on to examine Rene Descartes' vision of a society transformed by reason, Blaise Pascal's critique of Cartesian rationalism in the name of the soul, and Alexis de Tocqueville's analysis of early American "individualism" in light of this philosophic debate.  We also consider contemporary accounts of these issues.  Students should expect weekly writing assignments and intensive class participation.

The American revolutionaries learned quickly that it is easier to overthrow a government than create a new one.  The wartime utopianism
that envisioned America as a shining “City on the Hill” gave way to a
more pragmatic theorizing which asked the most basic questions of
political philosophy: Who is to rule, and through what mechanisms?†
When may the state legitimately coerce its citizens?  What makes us a
society; what is the "glue" that holds us together?  This seminar
invites students to think critically about these concerns, and use the
ideas generated at our nation’s birth to question the political
developments of our own time.
<br>
The first half of the seminar explores the ideas informing the period
from the Revolutionary War to the Constitution’s ratification,
emphasizing pervasive disagreement over the most basic elements of
political society.</td></tr></table>
We ask not only what issues from the constellation
of political principles were settled by the Conventions, but also what
possibilities were (and are) left open to America.
<br><br>
 

The second part of the seminar uses these principles to gain critical
leverage on a range of 21st century American debates.  From the
mundane to the spectacular, we examine such issues as economic
inequality, campaign finance reform, environmental degradation,
privacy, and terrorism.  Finally, we ask whether the Founders beliefs
should continue to hold relevance for us today, or if we think our
very different world calls for a break with the past and a
reformulation of our most basic political commitments.
