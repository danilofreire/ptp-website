&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h4>
Globalization and Development: </h4>

Globalization has been defined as the movement of goods, capital, persons, ideas and culture across political boundaries. What institutional structures accelerate globalization in this sense; which structures create friction against globalization? Who, if any one, controls these structures? How does cross-cultural exchange affect artistic and cultural creativity? What is the impact of global mass markets on the phenomenon of deep poverty? What are the obligations of individuals in wealthy countries to their “global neighbors” in desperate poverty? The Coca-Cola Corporation is the largest employer in Africa. Brown students committed to alleviating African poverty react with alarm when confronted with the question of whether the most efficacious means for them to help people in Africa is to contribute to Oxfam or to buy products made by the Coca-Cola Corporation. How should economic facts affect people’s understanding of themselves as moral agents? Does a commitment to “global citizenship” imply a commitment to “global capitalism?”  Is democracy possible, or desirable, on a global scale?
