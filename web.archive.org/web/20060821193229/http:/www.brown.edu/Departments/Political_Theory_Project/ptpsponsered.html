<a name="americanfounding"><h4><font color="black">The Philosophy of the American Founding</font></h4>

In what theoretical context was the constitution created? What problems 
were the Founders attempting to address? A great deal of modern 
scholarship centers on the influence of philosopher John Locke. Some scholars 
argue that his was the primary influence. This seminar will examine 
these claims by comparing John Locke's thought with that of some of the 
more influential Founders. Enrollment limited to 20. Written permission 
required.

role of liberty in his account of political association. Starting with 
philosophical fundamentals of thought, will question if his specifically 
individualist account of political liberty is the result of a 
generalization of a generalization of a thesis about the nature of the self and 
limits of its faculty of reason. Enrollment limited to 20.

political and religious authority. What effect does liberty of the mind 
have on the way individuals and societies decide what is right and 
enforce those decisions? We begin with Plato's classic statement in The 
Apology of Socrates and go on to examine Rene Descartes' vision of a 
society transformed by reason, Blaise Pascal's critique of Cartesian 
rationalism in the name of the soul, and Alexis de Tocqueville's analysis of 
early American "individualism" in light of this philosophic debate. We 
also consider contemporary accounts of these issues. Students should 
expect weekly writing assignments and intensive class participation.

We ask not only what issues from the constellation of political 
principles were settled by the Conventions, but also what possibilities were 
(and are) left open to America. 
<br><br>
The second part of the seminar uses these principles to gain critical 
leverage on a range of 21st century American debates. From the mundane 
to the spectacular, we examine such issues as economic inequality, 
campaign finance reform, environmental degradation, privacy, and terrorism. 
Finally, we ask whether the Founders beliefs should continue to hold 
relevance for us today, or if we think our very different world calls for 
a break with the past and a reformulation of our most basic political 
commitments.
