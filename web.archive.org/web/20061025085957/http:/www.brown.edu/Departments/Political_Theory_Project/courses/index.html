<h2><br/>
  Political Theory Courses</h2>
<h2><em>Spring 2007</em></h2>
<p><br/>
  <strong>PS 82-15 Ancient and Modern Political Thought: Viguier<br/>
  </strong>This course is a general study of significant political thinkers and ideas. The seminar covers the two great historical periods of Western political philosophy, ancient and modern. Representative thinkers and ideas from each period are used to illustrate important insights on the human experience and political predicament. Among the major political philosophers considered are Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau. </p>
<p><strong>PS 0105: Ethics and Public Policy: Frazer <br/>
</strong>This course is intended to help students think critically about the controversial ethical questions which are being so hotly debated in the formulation of public policy today. We will try to weigh both sides of current arguments over distributive justice and economic policy, the rights of women and racial minorities, the political status of the family, the regulation of the beginning and end of life, and the conduct of our foreign policy. Students will see that questions of morality arise in the formulation of public policy, not only with regard to so-called &ldquo;values&rdquo; issues, but with regard to virtually all areas of political life.</p>
<p><strong>PS 104 Ancient Political Thought: Corbett<br/>
</strong>The Greeks and Romans stand at the beginning of the Western tradition of political philosophy, yet their thought is somehow foreign. What was the special perspective from which they viewed political life? Does that perspective vitalize or confuse our own thinking on justice, education, and the good life? This course examines these and other questions through a close reading of Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>PS182-51 Modern Classical Liberalism: Tebble</strong><br/>
  This political philosophy senior seminar provides an in-depth exploration and critical appraisal of key texts in the modern Classical Liberal tradition. One of the most well known modern theories of Classical Liberal institutions â€“ Friederich Hayek's epistemological defense of liberalism - will be our starting point. Subsequently we will examine contemporary currents in Classical Liberal thought; more specifically, Chandran Kukathas&rsquo;s liberal tolerationist response to cultural diversity. Finally Milton Friedman&rsquo;s arguments that seek to link economic freedom with political freedom and Robert Nozick's rights-based account of the minimal state will be examined in detail.</p>
<p><strong>PL 99: Moral Metatheory: Brennan<br/>
</strong>Moral theory investigates morality, but moral metatheory investigates moral theory. Some problems we&rsquo;ll consider include: Is moral theorizing worthwhile? What&rsquo;s the point of moral theory? What should good theories do? Does widespread disagreement or the reliance on questionable intuitions invalidate moral theorizing? What exactly does the moral theorist know? What counts as good philosophical methodology, and how do we know? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Fall 2006 <br/>
    </em><br/>
      <strong>Intro/Freshmen  seminars</strong>:</h2>
<p><strong>TebbleÂ Â - Â  PS  11 Introduction to Political Thought â€“ C Hour</strong><br/>
  Why do laws made by  other people have authority for me? Can it be fair for one person to be  wealthier than another? How free should society be? Is sexism like racism? Such  questions are explored through a careful reading of some classic texts in  political philosophy, from the fourth century B.C.E. to the present. Enrollment  limited to 250. Written permission required.</p>
<p><strong>BrennanÂ Â -Â Â  PS  82-05 Freedom (Freshmen seminar) â€“ P Hour</strong><br/>
  What is freedom? Is  it important? How do we know? What should we do about it? We will analyze the  different conceptions of liberty - liberal egalitarian, classical liberal,  Marxist, and fascist views. We will determine how the various aspects of  freedom political, personal, psychological, economic, and moral are  complementary, and determine what sorts of institutions promote or undermine  these aspects. Enrollment limited to 20. Written permission required. FYS</p>
<p><strong>CorbettÂ Â -Â Â  PS 82-06 Philosophy of the American  Founding (Freshmen seminar) â€“ </strong><strong>Â Â 8:30-9:50 W/F</strong><br/>
  In what theoretical context was the constitution  created? What problems were the Founders attempting to address? A great deal of  modern scholarship centers on the influence of philosopher John Lock. Some  scholars argue that his was the primary influence. This seminar will examine  these claims by comparing John Locke's thought with that of some of the more  influential Founders. Enrollment limited to 20. Written permission required. FYS</p>
<h2>  <br/>
  <strong>Senior Seminars:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>VigueierÂ - PS  182-44 Justice and the City â€“ Wed 6:00-8:00pm</strong><br/>
  Examines selected  problems in political thought against the backdrop of urban settlements,  emphasizing dilemmas posed for liberal political theory by dramactic  inequalities of wealth and life chances, and diverse identities and  associations. Readings are drawn from a range of classic texts and recent  studies in political theory, sociology, economics, and urban studies.  Enrollment limited to 20.</p>
<p><strong>FrazerÂ -Â  PS  182-58 German Moral and Political Thought â€“ P Hour</strong><br/>
In the late eighteenth and nineteenth century,  German thinkers produced some of the most original and challenging work on  ethics and politics ever written. This course will include close readings, in  translation, of the writings of Kant, Herder, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Marx, and  Nietzsche. Themes discussed will include the foundations of morality and the  proper relationship between ethics, politics, and economics. Enrollment limited  to 20. Written permission required.</p>
