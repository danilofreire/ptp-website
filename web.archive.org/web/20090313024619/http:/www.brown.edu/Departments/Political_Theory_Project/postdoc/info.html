<p>Post Doctoral Research Associate, Political Theory Project, BROWN UNIVERSITY---The Political Theory Project at Brown will be appointing up to seven post-doctoral fellows from fields such as Political Theory, Political Philosophy, Constitutional History, American Founding Period, Religion and Politics, Political Economy, Legal Theory, and History of Economic Thought. Fellows pursue their own research, participate in Project-related activities, and teach (at most) one small seminar per semester. Salary is competitive. Appointment as Post Doctoral Research Associate is for one year, but may be renewable. Applications should include CV, three confidential letters of reference, a one-page research plan, and a writing sample of no more than 20,000 words. See below for details about the Projectâ€™s research and pedagogical missions, and a list of sample courses the Project would like to see developed. On their cover letter, applicants must indicate which Project-sponsored course they would most like to teach. Applications received by November 10, 2008 will be assured of full consideration.</p>
<p>Please send applications to: Post-Doctoral Search, The Political Theory Project, Box 2005, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912. </p>
<p>Brown is an affirmative action, equal opportunity employer.</p>
<h2><br/>
  Teaching Philosophy of the Political Theory Project</h2>
<p>The pedagogical mission of the Political Theory Project is to enliven and enrich political debate by fostering <em>responsible ideology</em>. Responsible ideology means putting in the hard work to be justified in holding one&#8217;s political views.<br/>
  <br/>
This requires a synthesis of humanistic and social scientific methods---normative, historical, and positive approaches to political knowledge. Political philosophy contributes to our understanding of what is just and what kinds of things have fundamental value. History teaches us where we have come from and what has been tried. The social sciences contribute to our understanding of how the world works and what is feasible. To know what political regimes we should advocate all things considered, we need insights from all these areas. We need to know whether our values are the right ones to realize through politics. We also need to know how social institutions work in practice to discover what best realizes our values.<br/>
<br/>
Philosopher John Stuart Mill suggested that one is not in a good position to hold one&#8217;s views until one knows what it would be like to hold contrary views. We want to help students take those differing perspectives. Responsible ideology means confronting contrary views with an open and active mind.<br/>
<br/>
Numerous studies suggest that people tend to converge on political beliefs they find pleasing rather than on those for which they have good evidence. We want to provide Brown students with the opportunities to avoid this danger. We create intellectual discomfort. Our master method is <em>Socratic</em>: to question everything. We do this not to inspire skepticism but to invigorate political thought. We search for problems with our favored views and for fresh ways to challenge our presuppositions. We ask ourselves the hard questions. Better yet, we find a way to turn the easy questions into hard questions. Responsible ideology means embracing the possibility that the things that seem most obvious are not obvious at all. <br/>
<br/>
We encourage respectful confrontation. That means holding up each idea for inspection as if it were new. We promote intellectual freedom by empowering students to break the chains of their own dogmatism.<br/>
<br/>
In announcing these principles, of course, the Project is in no way implying any criticism of existing courses at Brown. We are aware that many courses on political topics at Brown strive to create an open learning environment like the one which PTP-sponsored courses hold up as their ideal. Further, we recognize that it is sometimes appropriate that a course be devoted not to multiple perspectives, as PTP courses are, but instead provide students with a chance to encounter one author, one ideology, or one set of principles in a sustained way (e.g. a semester-long course on Karl Marx, or Adam Smith, for example). However, we do assert the ideals below as appropriate for any and all courses that are sponsored by the Political Theory Project. Thus, the principles enunciated below are intended define the Project&#8217;s own curricular niche.<br/>
<br/>
Political Theory Project-sponsored courses have the following features:<br/>
<br/>
1. They cover topics of fundamental and enduring significance.<br/>
2. They challenge students to think rigorously about their own deepest assumptions, typically by examining the topics from diverse ideological perspectives.<br/>
3. They tend to cover both classic and contemporary texts on the topic.<br/>
4. They are writing and discussion intensive.<br/>
5. They are interdisciplinary or at last open to being interdisciplinary, focusing not merely on normative political philosophy but also using the tools of historians and, where appropriate, of the social sciences.<br/>
6. They are conducted in a &quot;open learning environment&quot;, that is, an environment of mutual respect in which students feel not only comfortable, but excited, about sharing their ideas, regardless of how unpopular their ideas are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>COURSES ALREADY DEVELOPED<br/>
