The Political Theory Project is funded entirely by outside grants and 
gifts from generous individuals.
<br><br>


For advice and encouragement during the launch of the Project, I thank 
Ambassador Curtin Winsor '61 and Thomas J. 
Tisch '76. For major Project expenses for the 
2004-5 year, I gratefully acknowledge support from:  the W. F. Donner 
Foundation of New York, the Donner Canada Foundation of Toronto, The 
Institute for Humane Studies of Fairfax, Virginia, and from The Alice M. &amp; Thomas J. Tisch Foundation.
The Project is now seeking support for the 2005-6 academic year and 
beyond.



<br><br>




All contributions to particular projects at Brown must be done with 
the approval of Brown's senior administration, and thus must be 
coordinated by Brown's Office of Development. If you would like to make a donation, please contact me directly and I 
will put you in touch with the appropriate member of Brown's Office of 
Development.  If you simply would like more information about the 
Project and our mission, again, please write to me (My direct email is:

line).

<b><font color="000000">An itemization of the Political Theory Project's major needs for the 
2005-6 academic
follows:</font></b><br><br>

<b><font color="000000">Liberty Lunches:</font></b>  20 Lunches at $100 apiece.
         Each Monday during term time, the Project hosts a brown-bag 
lunch at
which Brown undergraduates meet with Project Fellows to discuss an
important theme about liberty. Your donation pays for reading materials
and soft drinks for participants.
<br><br>
<b><font color="000000">Public Lectures:</font></b> 4 Lectures at $2,500-$10,000 apiece.
         The Political Theory Project hosts public lectures on campus, 
with a
special interest speakers who thoughtfully challenge prevailing moral
and political orthodoxies. Your donation brings such a speaker to Brown
by paying speaking fees and travel expenses, plus advertising costs.
<br><br>
<b><font color="000000">Free Your Mind Conference:</font></b>  1 Conference at $35,000.
         Early each fall term, the Project hosts a weekend-long 
conference to
introduce a large group of Brown Undergraduates, and especially members
of the incoming Freshmen class,  to the idea of a free society. Your
donation allows us to bring in exciting speakers from around the
country, to provide reading materials and t-shirts for students, meals,
and to cover our advertising and programming expenses.
<br><br>
<b><font color="000000">Political Theory Project Visiting Fellowships:</font></b> 5 Fellowships at $52,500
apiece.
         The Visiting Fellows program is the heart of the Political 
Theory
Project, and its most important feature by far. Your donation allows
the Project to select a young scholar to spend a crucial year at Brown,
early in her or his career. The fellow conducts original research,
interacts regularly with Brown faculty and graduate and undergraduate
students, and, most important, adds exciting new Political Theory
Project sponsored courses to the Brown undergraduate curriculum.
<br><br>
Naming rights for each of these events, and for Brown's Political 
Theory Project as a whole, are negotiable with the Project director and 
with Brown's administration and Development Office.
