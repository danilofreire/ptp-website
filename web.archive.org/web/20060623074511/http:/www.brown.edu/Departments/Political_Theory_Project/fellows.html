<table border="0" cellspacing="1" align="center" width="96%"><td><font size="2" color="white"><br><br<br><br><br>Carmen Pavel is a graduate research fellow with The Political Theory Project. She is pursuing her Ph.D. in Political Theory in the Department of Political Science at Brown University. Her research focuses on contemporary liberal theory, with special attention given to liberal international norms. Her broader research and teaching interests extend to multiculturalism, theories of rights, ethics and public policy and the interplay of political theory and economics.
<br>Recently, political philosophers have focused their attention on the implications of moral pluralism for liberal theory. Indeed many argue that there is a strong foundational relationship between moral pluralism and liberalism. Carmen's dissertation , entitled “Pluralism and the Moral Grounds of Liberal Universalism”, argues first, that the supposed foundational link between liberalism and moral pluralism is philosophically untenable. When we disaggregate the scope of liberal theory and further distinguish between several levels of moral pluralism, the link between pluralism and liberalism starts. While pluralism is certainly compatible with liberalism, it does not ground a new defense of liberal theory.

Theory Project at Brown University.  He specializes in the history of 
political philosophy, and is currently examining John Locke's Two Treatises 
of Government.  While Locke is strongly associated with the rule of 
law, he justifies violations of the law when necessary.  This observation 
leads to the following inquiries.  Why would extralegal action be 
legitimate?  How can it be reconciled with the rule of law? What is to 
prevent the wielder of prerogative from using it tyrannically? The Second 
Treatise in particular is an attempt to grapple with these questions.
<br><br>
Ross Corbett teaches courses on the philosophy of the American 
founding, constitutional law, and Machiavelli.  He received his B.A. from the 
University of Maryland, College Park in 1999, and his Ph.D. from the 
University of Toronto in 2005.

His specialisations are in liberal political theory, multiculturalism and nationalism and he has published work in the journals Political Theory, Political Studies and Economics and Philosophy.  Dr. Tebble is currently completing a book that defends a neutralist ‘epistemological’ account of liberalism as a response to the challenge of cultural diversity.  In Discovering Cultural Justice: Identity, Democracy and the State the challenge of diversity is addressed by way of an insight concerning the epistemological rather than teleological rôle of liberal economic institutions first had by Friederich Hayek.

primary research interest centers on the nature of justice in 
transitional societies, which is the subject of his dissertation. Africana 
political thought, contemporary political theory, democracy and 
democratization and Caribbean politics all form his major teaching interests.

His dissertation is a normative inquiry into the problems associated 
with claims of justice in deeply divided societies such as South Africa. 
It explores various candidate theories of transitional justice and how 
best to respond to both the imperatives of building a common future  
while not abrogating the necessity of rectifying historic injustice.

theories of justice and legitimacy, decision making, and the relationship 
between facts and norms. John also does most of the administrative work

John's paper "Libertarianism and the Limits of the Reasonable" is 
currently under review. Navigating the treacherous waters between liberal 
justice and liberal legitimacy, the paper discusses the place of 
libertarianism in liberal political thought. It concludes that theories of 
libertarian justice are compatible with more liberal views on political 
legitimacy, despite the fact that many libertarian authors hold distinctly 
illiberal views about political legitimacy.<br><br><br><br></td></table></td></table>
